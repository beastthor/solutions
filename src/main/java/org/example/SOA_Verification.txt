//CIASN

for me I have to look for API called CIASN and DFTP.

they are -ve cases for CIASN either from host or zos connect;

// DFTP:

DFTP is -ve cases.

firewall request raised by Helena for DFTP for Tony.

The reason is that the DFTP is in the PCI zone . It has a more enhanced security level. we even can't call it in our local.

so we have raise specific firewalls for our individual laptops.

NETP0113444 - due date is monday - tony

preeti to follow up.

PAT has a longer window , so it should be okay.
