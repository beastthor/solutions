For example :


Take DDTA as example:

1)Go to consumer and consumer requests

for example one consumer is CMOB

check for CMOB is calling which endpoint . dont give end point to test for the consumers.


so Go back  to API consumer guide

1)May be look for each one of the functionality.

2)check and found them where the end point is and let the consumer know which query or functionality to run.

//Now consider easyweb as another consumer
EZW->DTAP->DTA

Again check the endpoint and go back to consumer guide and look each one of them adn let them know the functionality to run.

// kavitha to let the consumers direct to me for the connectivity testing.



//DDTAP
