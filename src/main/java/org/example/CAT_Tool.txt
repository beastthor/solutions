Certification Assessment Tool(CAT):

The Certtification assessment tool is a node.js command line tool that is designed to reduce API certification
timeline and cost. The CAT autogenerates an audit report and an assessment report for the API, when run against
the API source code.

CAT can be run by LoB API developers during the development, to understand the API certification readiness.when
the CAT passes certification, the API can be submitted to API mangement team. API management consultants run the CAT
tool to generate the digitally signed certificate when the assessment passess. The digitally signed certificate is
pushed to the Bitbucket indicating the API is certified and ready for production.
